### Scratch Arduino is Scratch 3.0 with Arduino and Arduino Robot Extensions.
Arduino programming hasn't been easy, but using Scratch to program Arduino, it is more fun and simple than ever before!
* **Interactive Mode** - Connect sprites with Arudino Robots or Arduino Boards, and use them to interact with Arduino Robots or Arduino Boards
* **Program Mode** - Use Scratch to program Arudino Robots or Arduino Boards, and run them offline
